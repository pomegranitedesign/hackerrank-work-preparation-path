 * Program name: Comparator
 * Explanation:
 *  Comparators are used to compare two objects. In this challenge, you'll create a comparator and use it to sort an array. 
 *  The Player class is provided in the editor below. It has two fields: 
 *    name: a string.
 *    score: an integer.
 *  Given an array of n Player objects, write a comparator that sorts them in order of decreasing score. 
 *  If 2 or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically ascending by name. 
 *  To do this, you must create a Checker class that implements the Comparator interface, then write an int compare(Player a, Player b) 
 *  method implementing the Comparator.compare(T o1, T o2) method. 
 *  In short, when sorting in ascending order, a comparator function returns -1 if a < b, 0 if a === b , 1 and a > b if .
